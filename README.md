# üß† Detecting Questions in User Input Using Python


### [By Srushti Shimpi](https://github.com/srushtishimpi)




## ‚úÖ Introduction

Detecting whether a sentence is a **question** (interrogative) is an essential task in natural language processing (NLP), chatbot development, and rule-based classification systems.

While machine learning models can be trained for this task, it's often faster and more efficient to use a rule-based approach‚Äîespecially when the structure of the language is predictable. This tutorial walks you through how to detect whether a sentence is a question using simple Python logic.



## üéØ Objective

To write a Python program that:
- Accepts a sentence from the user
- Detects if the sentence is an interrogative question
- Prints a message indicating whether or not the sentence is a question



## üß† Understanding Interrogative Sentences

A question usually starts with specific words known as **interrogative words**. Some common examples include:

- What  
- Where  
- When  
- Why  
- Who  
- How  
- Is  
- Are  
- Do  
- Does  
- Can  
- Could  
- Would  
- Will  

For example:

‚ùì *What is your name?*

‚ùì *Where do you live?*

In both cases, the sentence begins with an interrogative word, making it a question.

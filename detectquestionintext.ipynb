    "\n",
    "Detecting whether a sentence is a **question** (interrogative) is an essential task in natural language processing (NLP), chatbot development, and rule-based classification systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "While machine learning models can be trained for this task, it's often faster and more efficient to use a rule-based approach‚Äîespecially when the structure of the language is predictable. This tutorial walks you through how to detect whether a sentence is a question using simple Python logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "To write a Python program that:\n",
    "- Accepts a sentence from the user\n",
    "- Detects if the sentence is an interrogative question\n",
    "- Prints a message indicating whether or not the sentence is a question\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## üß† Understanding Interrogative Sentences\n",
    "\n",
    "A question usually starts with specific words known as **interrogative words**. Some common examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What  \n",
    "- Where  \n",
    "- When  \n",
    "- Why  \n",
    "- Who  \n",
    "- How  \n",
    "- Is  \n",
    "- Are  \n",
    "- Do  \n",
    "- Does  \n",
    "- Can  \n",
    "- Could  \n",
    "- Would  \n",
    "- Will  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì *What is your name?*\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùì *Where do you live?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, the sentence begins with an interrogative word, making it a question.\n",

    "In this article, we explored a simple Python-based approach to detecting questions in text using rule-based logic. While machine learning can enhance accuracy for complex datasets, this method is ideal for quick and lightweight implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We used a **rule-based approach** to identify interrogative sentences.\n",
    "- A basic check using .startswith() and endswith('?') can effectively identify many questions.\n",
    "- This solution is fast, easy to implement, and doesn't require training data.\n",
    "- The script checks if the sentence:\n",
    "  - Starts with a common **question word** (e.g., `what`, `how`, `can`)\n",
    "  - Or ends with a **question mark (`?`)**\n",
    "- The program accepts **user input**, analyzes it, and prints whether it is a question.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is lightweight, effective, and perfect for:\n",
    "- Beginners in Python\n",
    "- NLP or chatbot projects\n",
    "- Pre-processing text before feeding it into machine learning models\n",
    "\n",
    "While machine learning can also be used for question detection, this method is sufficient for many real-world applications without the overhead of training and deploying models.\n",
